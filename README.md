# agent-skills

Reusable **Devin** and **Cursor** skills and workflows for cross-project AI-assisted development.
Designed for research scientists and software engineers working on ML projects (surgical video MOT, HPC, DGX Spark, 3D recon, agentic loops).

## Overview

| Platform | Skills | Workflows / Commands |
|----------|--------|----------------------|
| **Devin** (`.devin/`) | 84 | 84 workflows (`/name`) |
| **Cursor** (`.cursor/`) | 91 | 94 commands (`/name`) |

- Every major topic has both a **skill** and a **workflow/command**.

Every major topic has both a **skill** (reference knowledge, auto-suggested) and a **workflow/command** (step-by-step procedure).

Skills use **progressive disclosure**: only `name` and `description` are loaded until the agent invokes them, keeping context lean.

## Usage

### In Devin
1. Copy the `.devin/` directory into your project root (or symlink it).
2. Skills are automatically discovered and invoked by the agent based on task relevance.
3. Workflows are invoked via `/workflow-name` slash commands.

### In Cursor
1. Copy the `.cursor/` directory into your project root (or symlink `skills/` and `commands/`).
2. **Skills** live in `.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — auto-suggested by the agent when relevant.
3. **Commands** live in `.cursor/commands/<name>.md` — invoked via `/name` in chat or referenced explicitly.
4. See `.cursor/README.md` for the full inventory and bootstrap guide.

**Cursor-only extras** (beyond the shared Devin set):
- Domain: `dgx-spark-cosmos3`, `nemotron-agent-loop`, `endosight-3d-pipeline`, `3d-reconstruction-best-practices`, `agentic-loop-design`, `spark-hardware-optim`, `surgical-video-data-pipeline`
- MOT: `mot-training-workflow`, `mot-repo-orientation`, `mot-browser-research`
- Cosmos/Spark commands: `/cosmos-verify`, `/esd-forward-dynamics`, `/esd-t2v`, `/lap-t2v`, `/cosmos-spark-kernels`
- Cursor workflow skills: `/review-bugbot`, `/ship-pr`, `/babysit-pr`, `/impact-aware-testing`, `/iterative-test-loop`, `/explore-sota`, `/fix-ci`, `/split-to-prs`

### Skill vs Workflow: When to use which

- **Skills** are auto-invoked by the Devin agent when it detects a relevant task. Use for
  knowledge that should be available on-demand (e.g., debugging guides, hyperparameter tables).
- **Workflows** are manually triggered via `/name` when you want to follow a specific
  step-by-step procedure (e.g., `/pretrain-and-evaluate`, `/code-review`).
- This repo provides both for every topic — use the skill for reference, the workflow for execution.
